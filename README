## 🌟 About the Project

Welcome to the **House Price Prediction** project! 🚀  
This project reflects my passion for **data science**, **machine learning**, and **software development**. It demonstrates my ability to handle real-world datasets, build robust models, and present insights clearly.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

> Predict the **price of a house** based on features like location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.  
> The goal is to build a **reliable regression model** that can assist buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

## ✨ Features

- 📦 Clean and process messy real estate data
- 🔍 Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🤖 Train and evaluate multiple regression models
- 📈 Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
- 💾 Save and reuse trained models using Pickle
- 🧠 Make real-time predictions from the trained model

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

### 🧹 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled **missing values** and **outliers**
- Used **label encoding** for categorical features
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Performed EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn

### 🤖 2. Model Building
- Models used:
  - 📏 Linear Regression
  - 🧮 Lasso Regression
  - 🌳 Decision Tree Regressor
- Performance metrics:
  - 📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - 📈 R² Score
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search

### 🚀 3. Model Deployment
- Model serialized using `pickle`
- Utility script (`util.py`) for model loading & prediction
- Modular structure for easy scalability
